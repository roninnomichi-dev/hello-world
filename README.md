**Questions/notes**
q. what is the best approach to handling a branch on my local git instance and sync with GitHub (given that nobody else is working on the project)? 
* should I start a branch here, then clone it back to local repo? 
* or just open branch locally, merge when done and push master on completion?
[1] possible clash with Markdown syntax symbols/Parsedown.php?
